<p>My friends and I have always tossed around the idea of using real-time Tweets to determine the popularity of a specific company. The vision, in it's entirety, is pretty grandiose but today I made a small step towards that goal. With the introduction of <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/streaming-apis">Twitter's Streaming API</a> comes a world of possibilities! When I saw this I knew I had to create a project with it. At the same time I've been ramping up on <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> so I thought: what better than to create a project with both technologies, plus <a href="http://socket.io/">Socket.io</a> for good measure. Thus, I present the Twitter Cashtag Heatmap!</p>
