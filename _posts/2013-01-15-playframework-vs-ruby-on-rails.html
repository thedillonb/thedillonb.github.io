<p>Over the past few months I've been playing a lot with web frameworks - and if you're just starting out, let me tell you: there's a lot of them. However, being that I typically work with me, myself, and I, it was easy to eliminate a lot of the frameworks that are more geared towards enterprise deployments and focus on those that provided rapid application development tools. I ended up playing a lot with Grails, Rails, Django, and Play!Framework - all of them very cool and impressive in their own right. However, the two that I ended up playing the most with were <a href="http://www.playframework.org/">Play!Framework</a> and <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby On Rails</a> and out of those two, I was most impressed by Rails. Let me tell you why.</p>

<h2>Praise for Play!</h2>
<p>First off, the Play!Framework is incredibly impressive, especially for being relatively new. I wrote a web application for a group in EMC a few years ago with the 1.0 release - and even then, it was extremely easy to get going and manage. Play! is now on version 2.0 and sports a few beautiful features and a nice synergy between Java &amp; Scala. If you're a Java or Scala developer this is definitely the framework to keep a close eye on. Even better, <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> just previously added support for Play!Framework applications in the cloud which makes deployment for this framework so so so easy.</p>

<h2>A Few Disadvantages of Play!</h2>
<p>That being said, here's the two things that drive me nuts about it: the lack of plugins and the lack of a proper IDE. While no fault of Play!'s, it's hard to really develop applications quickly when you're constantly re-inventing plugins that other frameworks have. Play! does have quite a few already (and will definitely continue to grow with time) but it in no way matches the sheer amount of plugins as Rails has. It's like night and day when playing with both these frameworks simultaneously - Rails has a plugin for almost any feature you can think of. Finally, while it may seem comical that I complain about the IDE I believe it's really important. Nothing upsets me more than the lack of proper code completion or syntax checking in this day and age.  The <a href="http://scala-ide.org/">ScalaIDE</a> has a lot of features and is probably the closest IDE to fully support Play!Framework that I've found it completely lacks support for code completion in the view. That's really unfortunate.</p>

<h2>Some Bad Rails First!</h2>
<p>Before I go off and sound like I'm another rails fan boy I want to share the things I dislike about rails: the Ruby language. When I started with Rails I never used Ruby before. It took some playing around with the language to learn the nuances and get a hang of it. However, I'm not sure exactly why, but coming from a C++, C#, Java kind of background it makes me feel odd when I'm writing ruby code. Given Python or Ruby to write a desktop application I would most likely always choose Python. If you choose to play around with Rails, or even use it for your next project, make sure you fully understand Ruby before you jump in; because you don't want end up struggling with the language while at the same time struggling with getting your web app out the door.</p>

<h2>Choo Choo: Rails!</h2>
<p>Right off the bad, the biggest benefit to using Rails is the gems. They're wonderful, plentiful, and so easy to install. They truly make your life easier when you're whipping together a project. Not only that, but the community is quite large. Rails has been around for a while so there is always someone to help you out of a jam and their documentation is pretty solid. Another factor I really enjoy about rails is that it abides by convention over configuration, which allows Rails to make a lot of magic happen automatically (sometimes without the developers knowledge of how, or why it is doing that). In addition, the fact that you can pretty much override every convention in some way shape or form makes it pretty easy to manage - although a typically do not override any of Rails' conventions. Finally, I come to the IDE: <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/">RubyMine</a>. The company JetBrains really makes some nice software and this IDE is sweet! There's so many features packed into this IDE that makes coding so easy. Especially because it s specifically designed around Rails! If you choose to develop a Rails application, definitely look into <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/">RubyMine</a>.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Until the amount of plugins for Play! increases to where I can typically find what I'm looking for without having to hack together something and a proper IDE is released with full support for all of Play! I will be sticking with Rails. Rails has a huge amount of plugins, RubyMine is an unsurpassed IDE for rails, and the amount of time to throw a decent looking product together is almost unmatched in any other framework. Go with Rails!</p>
