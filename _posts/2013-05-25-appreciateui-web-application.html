<p>Today I'd like to present the jQuery and AngularJS powered <a href="http://www.appreciateui.com">AppreciateUI web application</a>. Yesterday, I released a new iOS mobile application called <a href="http://www.dillonbuchanan.com/projects/appreciateui-mobile-ui-design-patterns/">AppreciateUI</a> and today I'd like to release the cousin to that application: <a href="http://www.appreciateui.com">AppreciateUI-Web</a>.Â This project was created to mirror the mobile application for those whom do not have an apple product or are not interested in the native mobile application. AppreciateUI-Web is constructed using HTML, CSS, jQuery, and AngularJS to form a responsive web application comfortably view-able on a desktop or mobile device. AngularJS provides the application structure and jQuery provides the necessary image DOM manipulation.</p>
