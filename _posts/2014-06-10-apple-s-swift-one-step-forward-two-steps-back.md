On June Second, Apple announced the very sleek and extremely welcome new development language for constructing iOS and OSX applications: [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/). Swift is the successor to Objective-C which has been the primary language for developing on iOS and OSX platforms. Swift is a completely new language that Apple has designed for the sole purpose of making it easier for developers to rapidly construct their applications. On the surface, this is great news.

It's about time that Objective-C was dethroned. The language is hard to pick up and incredibly difficult to master. My number one gripe against Apple was that their most advanced language to write iOS applications was Objective-C which is pathetic since Apple's competitors were using more advanced languages like Java and C#. Luckily, that day is past and Swift now brings modern development paradigms to iOS. Swift is  fast, modern, specifically designed to prevent common anti-patterns, and can run within an interactive playground! With Swift, Apple has taken a huge leap forward. Unfortunately, in a completely absurd direction.

Apple's decision to create a completely new language is rediculous. The last thing the world needs is another language let alone one that applies just to Apple's products. Apple just replaced Objective-C, a language that only they use, for Swift, another language that only they will use. Why create a new language when you could easily adopt an existing one? A new programming construct means that **everyone** will have to learn a the language. Oh Great! A language that applies only to Apple. 

When Apple says it's making it easier for developers to develop apps it means that exclusively for Apple developers - which makes sense for them but not for developers. As a developer, the last thing I want to do is lock myself into a single platform which is shrinking in market share. Moving Objective-C out of the limelight was the right thing to do. However, the wrong thing to do was develop a completely new language to supercede it.
