<p>A few months ago I stumbled upon <a href="http://www.bitbucket.org">Bitbucket </a>while fooling around with <a href="http://c9.io">Cloud9</a> - which, if you have not yet tried Cloud9, I highly recommend taking a look at! I was extremely impressed with Bitbucket. Up until then, I had only known about Github. One of my major complaints about Github was that I could not create private repositories without a paid subscription. But, I can't fault them for that. Private repositories don't pull in any additional traffic to the site except those that maintain the repositories. However, when I scanned through the features of Bitbucket I found the most welcome news: they give you free unlimited private Git, or Mercurial, repositories! Pretty cool.</p>

<h2>Big Potential</h2>
<p>I have always been a big fan of Atlassian's products. Bitbucket, being relatively new, is a welcome addition. What I'm extremely excited about is the possibility that many of Atlassian's former products will become strongly interwoven into Bitbucket. I'd love to see JIRA or Confluence strongly tied into Bitbucket. Providing a all-in-one solution for Git projects + bug tracking + collaboration tools is incredibly inciting. This is where Bitbucket will shine, especially over it's Github competitor. For now though it  would seem that the Bitbucket team has some work to do to differential themselves from their extremely popular competitor - especially in user interface which looks very similar (not that I felt Github had it right to begin with).  Regardless, if you haven't seen Bitbucket check it out!</p>
