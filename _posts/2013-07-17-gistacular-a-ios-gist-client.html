<p>I am pleased to announce the release of another open source iOS application: <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id670505001?mt=8">Gistacular</a>. Gistacular is a Gist client built using the Xamarin.iOS platform. It utilizes all of the features GitHub provides via it's Gist API to provide the user with a full, native, application. The app is probably one of the more visually appealing applications I've come up with and I highly recomend you check it out on <a href="https://github.com/thedillonb/Gistacular">GitHub</a>.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Gistacular is the best way to browse and maintain your GitHub Gists on any iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad device! Keeping an eye on your Gists has never been easier. Everything GitHub's Gist interface has to offer in the palm of your hand. Viewing Gists is as easy as can be and the ability to make comments, forks, and modify code is all there!</p>
