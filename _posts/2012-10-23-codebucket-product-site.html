<p>Ever since I launched CodeBucket I've really been after creating a proper product website. Well, today I've finally finished. Unfortunately, much of my time was spent attempting to do the entire thing in WordPress because I have quite a fondness for it. However, the lesson of the day is really ask yourself what you're attempting to accomplish with the website.</p>

<p>CodeBucket has a site of it's own: <a href="http://codebucket.dillonbuchanan.com">Check it out!</a></p>

<p>My first inclination was that I would us it to catalog feature requests. Well, thanks to Daniel May, I found that using a "HelpDesk" type of software is much more efficient than attempting to do it on my own. Daniel had pointed out <a href="http://www.zendesk.com">ZenDesk</a> which is an awesome looking product but I had found the pricing scheme a little interesting. Especially when compared to <a href="http://www.desk.com">Desk</a>'s free single agent it was hard to say no to Desk. I do think ZenDesk has a better overall product but for the price (free) I've gone with Desk. I've setup a <a href="http://support.codebucket.dillonbuchanan.com">support site for CodeBucket</a> which I hope to efficiently get to customer requests as well as create a proper knowledge base section for the application.</p>
<p>The second thought I had was that I would use WordPress' blogging tools to keep everyone up to date with the development of new features. However, after a lot of thought, for a small product like CodeBucket, it really doesn't make sense to have a whole blog dedicated to it's development. If it was a line of products, or maybe a much large product, than maybe. However, I think Twitter really does an excellent job of replacing that need. Thus, you can now follow <a href="http://www.twitter.com/codebucketapp">@CodeBucketApp</a> and I will keep you filled in as the product advances.</p>
<p>Finally, simplicity is key for a simple product. I completely forgot that in the 95% of the time I spent creating a product site. All this time creating a WordPress site when it really didn't need to be. Instead, I scrapped it and within a few hours came up with a much better alternative for CodeBucket: <a href="http://codebucket.dillonbuchanan.com">Check it out!</a></p>
