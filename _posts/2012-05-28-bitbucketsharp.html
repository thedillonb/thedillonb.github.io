<p>I've become so enticed with Bitbucket that last Friday I decided to create a .NET wrapper for their RESTful interface. It's called BitbucketSharp and can be found <a href="https://github.com/thedillonb/BitbucketSharp">here on GitHub</a> (ironically). The project is still in it's infancy but already supports a majority of the RESTful APIs <a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/Using+the+bitbucket+REST+APIs">exposed by Bitbucket</a>. The library is based on the wonderful <a href="http://restsharp.org/">RestSharp project</a> which made it extremely easy to make the necessarily requests. Feel free to use this project at will as it is licensed under the MIT open source initiative.  In addition, since I am quite taken with mobile application development I have decided to take my library and incorporate it into a Bitbucket mobile app which doesn't suck! I was not at all impressed with the apps already out there.</p>
