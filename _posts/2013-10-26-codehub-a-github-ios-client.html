<p>I'm extremely excited to introduce a new open source app I've been working on: <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/codehub-github-for-ios/id707173885?mt=8">CodeHub</a>. CodeHub is a GitHub client designed for the iOS platform - constructed using <a href="http://xamarin.com/ios">Xamarin.iOS</a>. After constructing CodeBucket, a Bitbucket client, I decided it would be wise of myself to design a framework to build code related apps in hopes that I would one day design one for GitHub and others. This way I could keep most of the functionaility the same and improvements on one would help the other. Well, that idea is finally coming to fuition as CodeHub has been released to the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/codehub-github-for-ios/id707173885?mt=8">iTunes App Store</a> and it's <a href="https://github.com/thedillonb/CodeHub">source code has been published to GitHub</a>.</p>

<h2>Feature Set</h2>
<ul>
<li>GitHub.com and Enterprise Support</li>
<li>Two Factor Authentication</li>
<li>Switch between multiple accounts</li>

<h2>Source Code</h2>
<p>All the source code for this application is stored <a href="https://github.com/thedillonb/CodeHub">here on GitHub</a>.  In addition, if you're so inclined, you can check out the push notification server that CodeHub will use <a href="https://github.com/thedillonb/CodeHub-Push">here on GitHub</a> - It is built using Node.js and MongoDB.</p>
