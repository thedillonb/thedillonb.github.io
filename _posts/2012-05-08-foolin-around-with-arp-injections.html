<p>My time at Acme Packet taught me a lot about networking. One of the interesting aspects of the job was to run tests that would normally be run with several pieces of equipment with only your piece of hardware and a desktop computer. To do this, although not the conventional way that would be taught, I created a script that would monitor my private network and respond to ARP requests that I knew I wanted routed back to my PC for inspection.</p>

<p>You can download the source <a href="http://dillonbuchanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ARPFoolin.zip">here</a>.</p>

<h3>A Little Explanation</h3>
<p>The code is one python file that you execute from the command line. It depends on dpkt which you can find <a href="http://code.google.com/p/dpkt/">here</a>. I tried to keep the code as neat and commented as possible. For the most part, many of the functions are self explanatory. However, all the magic that might need explaining is down at the bottom:</p>

<p>The first thing the application does when it enters the receive loop is grab 1500 bytes of data off the network. Since we're dealing with datagrams we'll need to specify a big enough buffer for the entire packet to fit in or else it will be discarded. Obviously, ARP packets are not 1500 bytes big, but I just wanted to be on the safe side. Next, the data buffer is passed to the dpkt algorithm for deserialization into an ARP object. Once complete, several key pieces of information are pulled from the packet: origin IP address, destination MAC address, and destination IP address. From here, the ARP packet's operation is checked to make sure it is an ARP request. If so, we'll check the destination's IP address against mask. If this packet is within our network mask, we'll create a new ARP response and fill it with the host's MAC address as the destination MAC. This way, the IP packet will be routed to us.</p>
