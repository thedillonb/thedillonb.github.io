<p>I've read countless books about startups over the past years. A few good, some bad, and a lot that really didn't say anything by the end. I thought I'd share some of the great books I've read in hopes that it will help you avoid the bad ones. The following is a list of five books, in ascending order to most favorable, that I think everyone should read. If you want to check out the book I've put the links to each in their respective title.</p>

<h2>5. <a href="http://100startup.com/">The $100 Startup</a></h2>
<p>This book is a great primer for the next four books I'll be recommending. It's a great place to start if you've never read a "startup" book before - or if the books you've previously read about "starting up" were unpleasant  The $100 Startup will really get you into the entrepreneurial mood and makes you wan't to put the book down and go start something. I actually found the book hard to read because I constantly wanted to put it down to go start on a new project! The core message of this book is simple: there is opportunity everywhere.  Making a career out of what you love to do is easy once you act on it and put the needed effort into the endeavor. Make sure to read this book in full because it has the basic principals that should serve as the cornerstone for any entrepreneur.</p>

<h2>4. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Steal-Like-Artist-Things-Creative/dp/0761169253/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1358812178&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=steal+like+an+artist">Steal Like An Artist</a></h2>
<p>This book is purely on this list for the fact that it helps people come to terms with the benefits of stealing. No, not stealing as in taking someone else's work, passing it off as yours, and taking a profit, but stealing as taking ideas that already exist, and manipulating them to find your voice. When Picasso said "Good artists copy, great artists steal" he too was reflecting on the fact that as creators, our work derives from those of the past - nothing is truly original, just a manipulation of what already existed. Steal like an artist presents ten principles that help readers discover their artistic side and build a more creative life.</p>

<h2>3. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Founders-Work-Stories-Startups-Problem-Solution/dp/1430210788">Founders At Work</a></h2>
<p>Founders At Work is an excellent book if you enjoy listening to the trials and tribulations of other founders when they were beginning their company. The book is a decent read, and much of what each founder says is similar to each other: "didn't scale well", "didn't have the money", "weren't prepared", etc... That being said, it's extremely important to avoid the mistakes these people have made. The biggest take away from this book is a series of "what not to do" lessons. It's also incredibly interesting on how many of these founders managed to find their initial niche. Most of them attempted something completely different and fell into their success. Regardless, the book is wonderful and provides an excellent example of what all founders will eventually run into during their journey.</p>

<h2>2. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Running-Lean-Iterate-Works-OReilly/dp/1449305172">Running Lean</a></h2>
<p>I only picked this book up a few months ago and it has truly made a great impact on my approach towards new projects. For those whom are not aware of the "lean" approach: the entire strategy is based on the fact that you wan't to start providing value as soon as possible by getting to know what your customers truly want and directly targeting their pain problems. The "lean" approach hopes to alleviate the pain of building a product that no one wants by quickly iterating your product to fit your customers wants. Running Lean is not the first book about the "lean" approach, but I believe it is the most to the point. The book discusses everything you need to know to properly validate your hypothesis while building your product. Running Lean stresses the big point of the "lean" approach: iterate, iterate, iterate! The book was a wonderful read, and most useful of all, you can read a chapter, apply it, then read the next one when you get to your next stage. It works well if taken step by step instead of reading the entire thing at once!</p>

<h2>1. <a href="http://37signals.com/rework">Rework</a></h2>
<p>This is by far one of my most favorite books to date. I've read the thing at least 10 times over and keep it within reach during the day. The authors, which are also the founders of <a href="http://37signals.com/">37signals</a>, do an excellent job of defeating the detrimental business mentality that everyone seems to inherently pick up along their careers. The true brilliance of this book is that every piece of advise is unique, direct, and to the point. There's no corporate mumbo jumbo or page filler, just intimate experiences from Jason and David. After reading the book it will definitely make you want to adjust how you do things in the work place. What great is that this book is not just for those interested in startups, it's a great book for anyone doing business with anyone. I highly recommend this book!</p>
