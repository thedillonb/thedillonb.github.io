<p>I'd like to introduce an iOS application I've worked extremely hard on for the past few months: <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/codebucket/id551531422">CodeBucket</a>. CodeBucket is the best way to browse and maintain your Bitbucket repositories on any iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad device! Keep an eye on your projects with the ability to view everything from followers to the individual file diffs in the latest change set. CodeBucket brings Bitbucket to your finger tips in a sleek and efficient design.</p>

<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Update 6/2/2013</em></span></h2>
<p>I have finally released the source for the CodeBucket project under the Apache 2.0 License. You can find the source code <a href="https://github.com/thedillonb/CodeBucket">here on GitHub.</a></p>

<h2>Inspiration</h2>
<p>As I've stated before, I'm a huge fan of Bitbucket. I believe it has immense potential. However, for the life of me, I could not find an iOS app that I was happy with. There were already a few out there at the time of developing my application: <a href="https://bitbucket.org/jamesRaybould/issue-bucket">Issue Bucket</a> and Bucketly are two that come to mind. Unfortunately, I wasn't particularly satisfied with their design and feature set. With that in mind, I set out to design my own application: <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/codebucket/id551531422">CodeBucket</a>. I designed CodeBucket to incorporate as many features as the <a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/Using+the+bitbucket+REST+APIs">Bitbucket REST API</a> provided. This, coupled with a efficient mobile design, allows the user to monitor repositories, provide issue feedback, search source code, and much more! My goal is that this application will embody the entire feature set that the Bitbucket website provides; I want this to be a complete mobile solution. I am extremely dedicated to this project and am currently working with Bitbucket to expose new API's to extend the feature set of CodeBucket!</p>

<h2>Design</h2>
<p>Here's a few images of the application in action:</p>

<h2>Support</h2>
<p>Please contact me if there is any comments, questions, issues, or features, you'd like to see addressed. <strong>I will be happy to work with anyone who provides feedback! </strong></p>

<h2>Open Source</h2>
<p>I will be providing the entire source tree for this project as well as a design document showing how I created every aspect of the application. As this was my first, I am currently re-factoring and cleaning up the code so views are better able to follow. Once that is complete, probably within a week or two, I will open source the repository!</p>
