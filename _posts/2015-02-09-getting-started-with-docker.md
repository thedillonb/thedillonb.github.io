Docker's popularity in the last year has really exploded. As I'm sure many have heard of it very few seem to have actually used it, or for that matter, understand what it's used for. In this article I will walk through creating a very simple Docker container which we can use for deployment. I will also discuss the very elusive **why** you would want to do such a thing. 

## First, what is Docker?


## What's so great about Docker?
Imagine for a second you program web services. These web services obviously don't want to only exist on your machine. At some point, you'll want to move this application to designated hosting servers. How do you get your code to those boxes? Do you zip up your application, copy it over and run it? Do you pull down the source on the servers and compile it? What about dependencies your application needs? I could go on and on about



You construct, test, debug, and repeat until you're satisfied with the result. In the end you'll have a repository full of source code. Great!
