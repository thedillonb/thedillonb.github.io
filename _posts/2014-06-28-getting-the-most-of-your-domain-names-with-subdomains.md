title: Getting The Most of Your Domain Names With Subdomains
categories: Entrepreneurship
---

Domain names are relatively cheap these days. Providers like [GoDaddy](http://www.godaddy.com/) offer _.com_ domains for $12.99, [1and1](https://www.1and1.com) for $14.99, and [Namecheap](http://namecheap.com) for $10.69 a year. Regardless of the provider, domain names are one of the lowest costing resources on the web today. However, before you go off and buy a multiple of domains, it is important to know how to make the most of the ones you have.

Almost all of the domain providers out there allow you to create what is known as a subdomain. A subdomain is simply defined a domain that is part of a larger domain. For example: "blog.msn.com" is a subdomain of "msn.com". Much like how "msn.com" points to a specific page on the web, the subdomain "money.msn.com" can point to it's own page on the web. In fact, if you open up a DOS prompt and type `ping msn.com` and compare it's output to `money.msn.com` you'll notice they ping completely different IP addresses. This is because subdomains may or may not point to the address of their root domain - It's completely up to you.

So, whats the big deal? Well, let's take the following example. I have several iOS applications in the app store: CodeHub, AppreciateUI, CodeBucket, etc... For each of these I'd like to create a landing page so that people who search for the name on Google can find a webpage devoted to that mobile application. Each of these landing pages will be styled different to best mimic the appearance of the mobile application. In addition, I'd like to have a unique, easy to read, and memorable, URL for each.

Web space aside, if I chose to buy a domain name for each mobile app I created then I'd end up spending, lets say $15 times the number of apps - which right now is 6. $90 is too rich for my blood especially for domains that just point to landing pages. Instead, I can utilize what I already have: _dillonbuchanan.com_. 

I pay $15 for _dillonbuchanan.com_ and, since I'm an indie developer, my apps are published under "Dillon Buchanan", why not just create subdomains for each app: codehub.dillonbuchanan.com, appreciateui.dillonbuchanan.com
